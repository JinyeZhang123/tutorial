<p>A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, 
    recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each). 
    A personal narrative is a prose narrative relating personal experience. Narratives are to be 
    distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic 
    enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches). A narrative 
    consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or discourse), in which 
    the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot, which can also mean "story synopsis"). 
    The term "emplotment" describes how, when making sense of personal experience, people structure and order 
    personal narratives.[10] The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events 
    (for example, the cat sat on the mat, or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, 
    diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms. 
    In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and 
    third-person narratives. As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling": 
    thus narrative technique is the method of telling stories, and narrative poetry is the class of poems 
    (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry. 
    Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes 
    narrative from non-narrative writings: this is called narrativity.</p>
